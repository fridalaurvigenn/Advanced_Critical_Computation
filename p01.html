          The “deep sea” is characterised by extreme conditions that make
          exploration challenging and fascinating.<br />
          Starting at approximately 200 metres (656 feet) and descending to
          depths surpassing 10,000 metres (32,808 feet),<br />
          the deep sea is divided into distinct zones based on depth, such as
          the mesopelagic,<br />
          bathypelagic, abyssopelagic, and hadalpelagic zones.

        <p>
          One of the defining features of the deep sea is the increasing
          pressure with depth, reaching extremes that<br />
          surpass 1,000 atmospheres or approximately 15,000 pounds per square
          inch (psi) in places like the Challenger Deep<br />
          in the Mariana Trench. The temperature in the deep sea is generally
          cold and stable, ranging from just abovebr <br />
          freezing to a few degrees Celsius, devoid of the temperature
          fluctuations observed in surface waters.

          Moreover, perpetual darkness shrouds the deep sea beyond a certain
          depth, as<br /> sunlight is unable to penetrate, prompting the evolution of
          unique adaptations in the organisms that<br /> call this lightless realm
          their home. These distinctive characteristics contribute to the allure
          and scientific<br /> intrigue of the deep sea, where exploration continues
          to unveil the secrets hidden in its depths.
