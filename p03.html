          Discuss the tools and technology used for deep-sea exploration. The
          oceans compose over 71 percent<br />
          of the Earth's surface and are the planet's largest ecosystem. Not
          only that it holds about 99 percent of all habitable<br />
          space, with a large variety of organisms thriving from the surface to
          the scorching waters of our deepest ocean vents<br />
          miles below. Submersibles, not very surprisingly have played a key
          role in exploring and understanding this last frontier.<br />Reaching
          astounding depths and capable of performing complicated scientific
          experiments, these advanced crafts<br />
          have even begun to tease out clues to the origin of life the formation
          of our planet. In this timeline, see just how<br />
          imaginatively (some of) these underwater machines have evolved over
          the decades.

              Trieste (1953) is a Swiss-designed, Italian-built deep-diving<br />
              research bathyscaphe(“deep-boat”), made by the Swiss inventor<br />
              August Piccard, who in the 1930s reached unprecedented altitudes
              <br />of almost 16,000 metres (52,000 feet) with his unique
              pressurised<br />
              aluminium gondola. Piccard modified his atmospheric balloon<br />
              concepts to design the Trieste, using gasoline, which is
              lighter<br />
              than water, for buoyancy. In 1960, the submersible dove more
              than<br />
              10,000 metres (35,000 feet) to the deepest point on Earth,<br />
              the Marianas Trench, withstanding a crushing pressure <br />of
              eight tons per square inch.

              As the oldest manned research submersible, which is<br />
              still in operation, Alvin (1964) boasts an impressive résumé.<br />
              Having done over 4,000 dives so far, this titanium sphere was<br />
              the first manned vessel to visit the wreckage of the Titanic.<br />
              The vessel has also helped researchers discover approximately<br />
              300 new animal species, including foot-long clams and giant<br />
              red-tipped tube worms. Thought to be lost in 1968 when the
              <br />support cables failed and it's crew abandoned ship, the
              craft spent<br />
              11 months on the seafloor, sustaining only minor damage.<br />
              Near-freezing temperatures and a lack of oxygen kept even<br />
              the lunches left onboard perfectly preserved.

              Ocean scientists safely travelled to deep-sea coral<br />
              ecosystems up to 3000 metres (9,843 feet) below the<br />
              ocean's surface inside the Johnson-Sea-Link (1971). It is a<br />
              highly manoeuvrable vessel that can accommodate up to<br />
              four people, but its chief claim to fame is its use of highly<br />
              specialised equipment. Using manipulator arms, suction
              <br />devices, and rotating sample-collection tools, the
              Sea-Link<br />
              makes it possible for crew members to execute,<br />
              from within the submersible, nearly every<br />
              task once performed by divers.

              Scientists designed Hercules (2003), a remotely <br />operated
              craft, specifically to study and recover artefacts<br />
              from ancient shipwrecks, but it can be used for a wide array of

              multipurpose tools,<br />
              one of the craft's two manipulator arms offers "force

              allowing operators miles away to better control the pressure the
              <br />device applies upon more delicate specimens, such as
              boxes<br />
              found aboard the Titanic . Equipped with a flotation device<br />
              composed of glass and epoxy resin, Hercules can "fly" in any<br />

              her thrusters stop turning, an innovation that could<br />
