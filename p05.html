          The deep sea is populated with whimsical and highly specialised
          creatures only <br />recently becoming known to us. While seemingly
          untouchable at their depths, climate change<br />
          impacts are increasingly encroaching on these cryptic ocean
          communities. The deep sea is <br />populated with whimsical and highly

          While seemingly untouchable at their depths, climate change impacts
          are increasingly encroaching on<br />
          these cryptic ocean communities. This especially is heightened by
          deep-sea mining which destroys<br />
          habitats and threatens various species that live in the sea beds. Not
          only that, deep-sea mining <br />can cause marine and chemical
          pollution due to sediments dumped into the oceans,<br />
          e.g., oil spills, which devastate marine diversity.

                <h4>
                  Deep sea ecosystems are part of a vast oceanic-planetary<br />
                  regulatory system. Through deep ocean mixing (mixing of
                  waters<br />
                  of different temperatures and densities), the deep sea helps
                  drive ocean<br />
                  currents. The deep sea also absorbs heat and atmospheric CO2.
                  In this way,<br />
                  the deep sea acts as a buffer from the effects of climate
                  change. However,<br />
                  the ocean can only hold so much heat and only so much CO2.
                  Once its<br />
                  capacity to absorb is overshot, the deep sea can no longer
                  provide <br />these services. If these systems are harmed,
                  they could exacerbate<br />
                  climate change by further contributing to methane gas
                  concentrations<br />
                  and inhibiting its ability to serve as a carbon and heat sink.

                  Warming of deep ocean waters caused by climate change<br />
                  also impacts the transport of heat, oxygen, CO2, and
                  particulate<br />
                  organic carbon from the ocean surface through ocean
                  circulation<br />
                  and mixing. From what scientists understand thus far, the deep
                  sea<br />
                  is a valuable carbon and heat sink. The health and functioning
                  of this <br />ecosystem are dependent on the health of surface
                  water ecosystems,<br />
                  which could be greatly impacted by climate change. Despite
                  the<br />
                  importance of the deep sea, there is a lack of policy and
                  scientific<br />
                  information about this ecosystem that makes up 90% of
                  Earthâ€™s<br />
                  livable area. Scientific understanding of the deep sea is
                  still<br />
                  an emerging field and more research needs to be done.

            Steps towards the protection of this ecosystem include conservation,
            creation of marine protected areas,<br />
            increased research, management, policy, and decreased atmospheric
            carbon emissions. Initiatives include the<br />
            establishment of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) to limit human
            activities, international collaborations like the United<br />
            Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) to regulate
            deep-sea practices, and the deployment of<br />
            advanced technologies such as remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) for
            non-invasive exploration. These measures<br />
            are necessary to maintain the health of the deep sea and preserve
            its ability to store carbon and heat,<br />
            manage methane, and regulate global climate.
